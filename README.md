## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Alt text](https://github.com/JoshTrewhella/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/D1_LR.PNG)

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
According to the data, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearing metrics are non-random. This implies these have a significant impact on the MPG.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not zero. We can determine this by looking at the p-Value, which is 5.35e-11 (smaller than the significance level of 0.05%). 

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The multiple r-squared value of 0.7149 implies that 71% of the mpg can be determined by the metrics included in this model. We can say that this model does predict the MPG of the prototypes effectively.
